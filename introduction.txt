# Brief Introduction About Myself
I am Hajar a young female graphic designer living in Casablanca who is eager to pivot her creative skills into the world of technology, with a particular focus on data analytics. 
Having honed my eye for detail and storytelling through design, I now seek to apply that same precision to interpreting data, uncovering insights, and building evidence-based strategies. 
Driven by curiosity and ambition, I envision blending my artistic background with analytical tools to craft compelling visualizations and reports that empower decision-makers. 
My journey reflects both a passion for innovation and a determination to carve out a meaningful career in tech, positioning myself as a bridge between creativity and data-driven impact.
